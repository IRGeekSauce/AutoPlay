# AutoPlay

What is it? 
-----------
AutoPlay is a simple automation tool used to
speed up opening your Windows Media Player so you 
can get right to work. It will search your Music 
folder, and if it is not empty, will begin with
the first song. If the folder is empty, the app
will suggest adding files to the folder and close.

Feel free to beef up the code and make something even cooler!
